# BUGS.md — text-to-cad repo issues hit during the F-14D Tomcat build

Running log of repo bugs, unexpected behavior, missing features, and doc gaps
found while building `models/renders/f14d/` on `release/0.4.0`. Problems with
the *aircraft* do not belong here — only problems with the repo. Format per
entry: what I was doing, exact command, exact error/wrong output, workaround,
blocked?, fixed?

This model is almost entirely large-scale lofted compound curvature, so the
loft/blend findings (§3–§7) are the ones worth reading first.

---

## 1. A theme JSON containing `edges` is rejected — and the repo's own example theme has one

- **Doing:** authoring a presentation theme for critic comparisons, starting
  from the repo's shipped example
  `models/renders/hypercar/render/presentation_theme.json`.
- **Command:**
  ```
  .venv/bin/python skills/cad/scripts/snapshot --job models/renders/f14d/render/out/body01_job.json
  ```
- **Exact error:**
  ```
  --theme JSON must be the theme settings object directly; unsupported keys: edges; edges belongs in display JSON
  ```
- **Why it matters:** the error message is good, but the only in-repo example of
  a hand-authored presentation theme —
  `models/renders/hypercar/render/presentation_theme.json`, 162 lines, ending in
  a large `"edges": {...}` block — is exactly the shape the CLI now refuses. So
  the documented-by-example path fails on the first run. Anyone copying it hits
  this immediately.
- **Workaround:** split the file — theme keys stay in
  `render/presentation_theme.json`, and the `edges` block moves into a separate
  `render/presentation_display.json` merged into the job's `display` object.
  Implemented in `models/renders/f14d/render/shot.py`.
- **Blocked:** no (~5 min). **Fixed:** no — logged only. The minimal repo fix is
  to move the `edges` block out of
  `models/renders/hypercar/render/presentation_theme.json` into a display JSON
  the same way, but that changes another model's render output, so it is not
  mine to make as a drive-by.

## 2. `render.padding` is silently clamped to a 0.1 minimum, and framing is by bounding sphere

- **Doing:** trying to fill the frame with a long thin fuselage
  (18.3 m × 4.5 m × 2.5 m) by tightening padding.
- **Command:** JSON job with `"render": {"sizeProfile": "assembly-large", "padding": 0.06}`.
- **Wrong output:** no error, no warning, no change. The aircraft occupied about
  a third of the frame width.
- **Cause:** two things compounding.
  `packages/cadjs/src/common/cadScene.js:2258` does
  `Math.max(1 - (clamp(Number(padding) || 0, 0.1, 0.4) * 2), 0.1)` — any padding
  below 0.1 becomes 0.1. Separately, framing is computed from the model's
  bounding SPHERE, so an object whose length is 4× its width is framed by its
  diagonal and can never fill the frame regardless of padding.
  (Note `renderOptions.js:485` does *not* clamp, so the floor depends on which
  path runs — worth reconciling.)
- **Workaround:** per-view `zoom` in the camera JSON is the only lever that
  actually crops in. Values are in `models/renders/f14d/render/shot.py`.
- **Suggestion:** either honour padding below 0.1 or warn that it was clamped;
  documenting that framing is sphere-based would have saved the guessing.
- **Blocked:** no. **Fixed:** no (logged, routed around).

## 3. `loft()` fails with a message that names nothing when sections disagree on point count

- **Doing:** first attempt at the one-piece airframe skin — a smooth multi-section
  loft through 63 closed section wires.
- **Command:** `loft(faces)` from `models/renders/f14d/f14_parts/body.py`.
- **Exact error:**
  ```
  ValueError: Recovery failed
  The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:
  RuntimeError: Failed to create valid loft
  ```
- **What was actually wrong:** my sections had 36, 38, 46, 50, 51 and 52 points
  depending on station, because samples where no component existed were dropped.
  Every section was individually valid and **every adjacent PAIR lofted fine** —
  only the full-set loft failed, and the error points at neither the station nor
  the cause.
- **Diagnosis that worked:** loft increasing prefixes (`faces[:k]` for
  k = 5,10,20,30,45,62) to bracket the failure, and loft every adjacent pair to
  rule out a single bad station. Worth adding to
  `skills/cad/references/repair-loop.md` next to the existing "bisect by lofting
  adjacent pairs" advice, which finds a *bad section* but not this.
- **Workaround:** guarantee a fixed sample count per section.
- **Blocked:** ~25 min. **Fixed:** no repo change; model-side fix.

## 4. A disconnected section silently produces an invalid `Face`, and the failure surfaces far away

- **Doing:** lofting the skin all the way to the tail.
- **Wrong output:** aft of the beavertail a station cuts the two engine nacelles
  as **two separate closed regions**. `Face(wire)` on that section raises
  nothing and returns a Face with plausible `area`; only `Face.is_valid` is
  False. The loft then fails with the §3 message, 60 stations away from the
  cause.
- **Workaround:** end the one-piece loft at the last connected station
  (`X_SKIN_AFT`) and build the nozzles as separate bodies — which is the real
  structural break anyway.
- **Blocked:** no, once §3's bisection was in place. **Fixed:** no.
- **Aside:** `Face.is_valid` is a **property**, not a method. Calling
  `f.is_valid()` gives `TypeError: 'bool' object is not callable`, which reads
  like a corrupted object rather than a spelling mistake, and cost a wasted
  diagnostic run.

## 5. LARGE-SCALE LOFTS: sections are matched BY INDEX, so non-feature-aligned sampling silently crumples the surface

**The single most expensive finding of this build**, and the one that matters
most for any model made of big blended surfaces.

- **Doing:** lofting 59 full-width sections through a body whose half-width goes
  from 0.01 m at the radome to 2.24 m at the glove.
- **Wrong output:** exit 0. Valid solid. Watertight. Bilaterally symmetric.
  `inspect` clean. And the whole aft fuselage rendered as **crumpled foil** —
  fine longitudinal wrinkles over every square metre of it.
- **Cause:** a loft interpolates its sections point index by point index. I was
  sampling each station at cosine-spaced fractions of that station's own
  half-width, so sample #40 sat on the nacelle crest at one station and out on
  the glove at the next. The surface twists between stations to reconcile them.
  Nothing reports this: it is a valid surface, just not the one intended.
- **Fix (model-side):** sample on **rails** — compute the lateral position of
  each feature line (nacelle axis, nacelle silhouette, forebody edge, outer
  silhouette) per station and allocate a fixed number of points to each
  rail-to-rail band, so index *i* means the same feature at every station. See
  `rails()` / `half_samples()` in `models/renders/f14d/f14_parts/sections.py`.
  Median inter-sample chord sagitta fell from 17.3 mm to 11.3 mm and the
  wrinkling went away.
- **Suggestion:** `skills/cad/references/build123d-modeling.md` already has an
  excellent section on `Plane.rotated()` being a silent wrong-shape trap. This
  belongs beside it — it is the same class of bug (valid geometry, wrong shape,
  every deterministic check passes, only a render finds it) and it is
  unavoidable for anyone lofting a varying-width body.
- **Blocked:** ~40 min. **Fixed:** no repo change; documented here.

## 6. LARGE-SCALE LOFTS: two silent ways a control curve ruins a surface

Both produced valid, watertight, symmetric solids that looked wrong.

- **Interpolating with `smoothstep` between control points makes a staircase.**
  `lerp(v0, v1, smoothstep(x0, x1, x))` has **zero derivative at both ends of
  every interval**, so the curve is flat at each control point and steep between
  them. Lofting through curves built that way put a crease at every knot, the
  full length of the fuselage. Replaced with monotone cubic (PCHIP) tangents.
  Worth flagging because `smoothstep` is the obvious reach for "smooth
  interpolation" and it is wrong for this.
- **Measurement noise becomes surface ripple.** Station data traced off a
  scanned drawing carries about a pixel of noise (≈8 mm here). A monotone
  interpolant reproduces it exactly and the loft turns it into visible waves.
  Two passes of a [1,2,1] kernel over the interior removed it without touching
  the shape.
- **Blocked:** no individually; together ~20 min. **Fixed:** model-side.

## 7. LARGE-SCALE BLENDS: log-sum-exp smooth-max has unbounded curvature; sampling cannot save it

- **Doing:** blending the forebody, nacelle, glove and tunnel volumes into one
  section by smooth-max, so the transitions are continuous by construction
  rather than filleted.
- **Wrong output:** a hard crease where the inlet shelf meets the forebody
  flank. Measured inter-sample chord sagitta there was 100 mm.
  **Doubling the section sample count from 53 to 97 changed it to 86 mm** —
  i.e. barely at all, because the corner is in the *function*, not the sampling.
- **Fix:** the softplus form `max(a,b) + k*log1p(exp(-|a-b|/k))` perturbs the
  surface everywhere and its curvature is unbounded as k shrinks. The
  polynomial form with compact support (`h = clamp(0.5 + 0.5*(a-b)/k, 0, 1)`;
  `b + (a-b)*h + k*h*(1-h)`) is exactly `max()` outside the blend band, has
  curvature bounded by ~1/k, and adds at most k/4 of material — so k can be
  opened up to 0.46 m without the shape ballooning.
- **The deeper lesson**, which cost the most time: **a closed lobe that ends
  inside the body is a cliff.** Any closed convex profile meets its own
  silhouette on a vertical tangent. Where the forebody lobe closed between the
  inlets, the shelf sat 0.23 m below it — a 50 mm-wide cliff that no blend width
  and no sample density could fix. The fix is architectural: widen such a lobe
  until it *overlaps* its neighbours, and cut the real feature back in
  afterwards. Same for the canopy, which had to become its own lobe because one
  half-width cannot serve both a 1.4 m fuselage and a 0.5 m canopy.
- **Blocked:** ~35 min across two rounds. **Fixed:** model-side.

## 8. Performance note (not a bug): smooth loft cost and quality

For the record, since the docs warn about dense periodic spline profiles being
fragile: a **smooth** (non-ruled) loft through 59 sections × 83 points each
succeeds in ~9 s and produces a solid with **4 faces** — one continuous B-spline
surface per side, no faceting at any render resolution. `ruled=True` on the same
input takes 0.16 s but yields 118 faces and visible chordwise banding. Smooth is
worth the 9 s here. No fragility observed at this size once §3–§7 were fixed.

---

## 9. Fusing DISJOINT solids returns a `ShapeList`, and the failure surfaces as a transform error

- **Doing:** building striped ejection-seat handles -- alternating yellow/black
  segments along one axis, each colour fused into a single leaf.
- **Command:** `models/renders/f14d/f14_parts/cockpit.py`, `_fuse()` then
  `Location * shape`.
- **Exact error:**
  ```
  ValueError: other must be a list of Locations
  ```
  raised from `build123d/geometry.py:1757` in `Location.__mul__`.
- **What was actually wrong:** `a + b` on two solids that do NOT touch returns a
  `ShapeList`, not a Shape. Every alternate segment of a striped handle is
  disjoint from the next one of the same colour, so this was the normal case,
  not an edge case. `Location * ShapeList` then fails with a message about
  *Locations*, which reads like a broken transform and sends you looking at the
  placement code rather than at the fuse three frames up.
- **Workaround:** `_fuse()` now collapses a `ShapeList` result into a single
  `Compound`. One leaf, one colour, transformable.
- **Blocked:** yes -- this module built nothing until fixed (~10 min).
  **Fixed:** model-side.

## 10. Stale render artifact: a generator that skips missing optional modules never rebuilds when one appears

- **Doing:** the assembly entry imports each part module and skips the ones that
  do not exist yet, so the aircraft stays renderable while builders work in
  parallel (the same pattern the repo's own
  `models/renders/hypercar/hypercar.step.py` uses).
- **Wrong output:** after nine part modules landed on disk, `snapshot` rendered
  the **airframe alone** -- no wings, no tails, no gear -- with no error and no
  warning. It printed `resolving input (building render artifacts if needed)`
  and reused the cached package.
- **Cause:** the artifact's source-closure hash is computed from the modules the
  generator actually imported AT BUILD TIME. When the first build ran the part
  modules did not exist, so they were never in the closure -- and their later
  appearance therefore cannot change the hash. The cache is self-consistent and
  permanently stale.
- **Workaround:** run `scripts/gen` on the entry explicitly after adding a
  module rather than relying on snapshot's implicit resolution.
- **Suggestion:** worth a line in `references/step-generation.md` -- the
  skip-missing-modules pattern is genuinely useful for parallel work, and this
  is its one sharp edge.
- **Blocked:** ~15 min spent believing the parts had failed to build when they
  had not. **Fixed:** no repo change.

## 11. Boolean cost against a large lofted B-spline is PER-TOOL and superlinear -- a 44-cutter build ran 7 hours without finishing

The most expensive finding of this build, and the one that governs how any
model made of big blended surfaces should be structured.

- **Doing:** cutting the real openings back into the one-piece airframe skin --
  the boundary-layer diverter slot, the cockpit opening, and 41 shallow panel
  recesses published by the part modules.
- **Command:** `scripts/gen models/renders/f14d/f14d.step.py`, where
  `airframe.py` does `skin - cutters` with 44 tools in ONE list operand.
- **Wrong output:** no error, no progress. The generation progress file entered
  `phase: "generate"` / `"Building geometry"` 3 ms after start and never updated
  again; the process sat at 98 % CPU for **7 h 06 min** and was cancelled, still
  inside a single uninterruptible call.
- **Measured cost curve** (skin alone lofts in 21 s and is 3 faces):
  ```
  skin - 1  cosmetic cutter      24.2s   OK
  skin - 4  cosmetic cutters     69.6s   OK
  skin - 41 cosmetic cutters   > 900s    did not finish
  skin - 3  structural cutters  348.2s   OK
  ```
  1 -> 4 tools is SUBLINEAR, then it breaks badly somewhere before 41. The 3
  structural cutters cost ~116 s each because they are large and cut deep.
- **Cause:** the skin is a single B-spline surface of roughly 4,900 control
  points. A `sample` of the stalled process showed the main thread entirely in
  `Extrema_ExtPS::Perform` / `Extrema_GenExtPS::Perform` -- point-to-surface
  projection -- with `BSplSLib_Cache::BuildCache` and
  `GeomAdaptor_Surface::RebuildCache` firing on nearly every evaluation. Cost is
  driven by full-surface classification PER TOOL, not by how much material each
  tool removes. OCC parallelises the intersection front-end (observed ~810 %
  CPU) and then drops to a single thread for the rest, which is where the hours
  go.
- **Workaround / fix:** drop cosmetic recesses as booleans entirely. At 19 m
  rendered to 1920 px, 1 px is ~10 mm, so a 4 mm groove is sub-pixel -- panel
  lines read because the renderer's edge overlay draws feature edges, not
  because the groove is resolvable. Keeping only the 3 structural cutters took
  the same assembly from ">7 h, cancelled" to a complete build in ~10 min.
- **Blocked:** yes, catastrophically -- 7 h. **Fixed:** model-side, in
  `models/renders/f14d/f14d.step.py`.
- **Suggestion:** `scripts/gen` giving *any* sign of life during a long
  `gen_step()` would have turned this from "is it hung?" into "this is slow".
  See also entry 4 of the earlier chronograph log, which is the same complaint.

## 12. The cad-viewer skill cannot start from a lightweight worktree -- four undocumented symlinks and a build are needed

The `cad` skill's handoff section is explicit and correct ("you must ALWAYS hand
the explicit file path(s) to `$cad-viewer`"). The problem is purely that the
documented one-liner does not work in a worktree.

- **Command:** `npm --prefix skills/cad-viewer/scripts/viewer run start -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3262`
- **Failure 1:** `Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'cadjs'
  imported from viewer/scripts/directoryRoot.mjs`.
  `skills/cad-viewer/scripts/viewer` is a SYMLINK to `viewer/`, not a
  self-contained bundle, so "packaged Viewer runtime" still needs the worktree's
  `node_modules` -- which `AGENTS.md` says worktrees deliberately do not have.
- **Failure 2:** after symlinking `viewer/node_modules` from the main checkout,
  the server starts and the CAD API answers, but `/` returns **404** -- `start`
  serves a prebuilt bundle and there is no `viewer/dist` in a fresh worktree. A
  working backend with no front end looks like a broken link, not a missing
  build.
- **Failure 3:** `npm --prefix viewer run build` then fails three times in a row,
  one bare specifier at a time:
  `Rollup failed to resolve import "implicitjs/common/camera.js"`, then
  `three`, then `meshoptimizer`, each from `packages/cadjs/src/...`. This is the
  SAME root cause as entry 1 of the chronograph log below -- it has now cost two
  separate projects.
- **Failure 4:** `meshoptimizer` is not under `packages/cadjs/node_modules`
  anywhere in the repo; the only copy is `docs/node_modules/meshoptimizer`, so
  the workaround is a symlink across an unrelated package.
- **Workaround (all four):**
  ```
  ln -s <main>/viewer/node_modules viewer/node_modules
  ln -s ../../implicitjs packages/cadjs/node_modules/implicitjs
  ln -s <main>/packages/cadjs/node_modules/three packages/cadjs/node_modules/three
  ln -s <main>/docs/node_modules/meshoptimizer packages/cadjs/node_modules/meshoptimizer
  npm --prefix viewer run build
  ```
- **Blocked:** yes, ~40 min. **Fixed:** no -- worked around locally.
- **Suggestion:** a "starting the Viewer from a lightweight worktree" section in
  `skills/cad-viewer/SKILL.md`, and a pointer to the launcher command from the
  `cad` skill's Handoff section, so the requirement and the means live together.

## 13. The Viewer catalog skips dot-directories, so a model under one is invisible

- **Doing:** opening a model that lived at
  `models/renders/f14d/.review/full/full.step.py`.
- **Wrong output:** the Viewer reported the file does not exist. Querying the
  catalog with an explicit `?dir=` pointing INTO the hidden directory returned
  the entry fine, but scanning from the `models` root listed only
  `renders/f14d/f14d.step.py` -- everything under `.review/` was skipped.
- **Cause:** the catalog scan ignores dot-directories. Reasonable by itself, but
  it is invisible: the entry resolves by direct query and not by scan, so the
  link 200s and the model still will not load.
- **Workaround:** keep buildable entries out of dot-directories.
- **Blocked:** no. **Fixed:** no.

## 14. RETRACTED -- "render artifacts are not relocatable" was my own bad probe

Logged during the build, then disproved. Recording it as retracted rather than
deleting it, because the way it fooled me is the useful part.

- **What I claimed:** that moving a built render package leaves the catalog
  resolving the entry while every component asset 404s.
- **Evidence I had:** `curl /__cad/asset?file=<...>.step.py` returned
  `{"error":"Not found"}` for both a copied package AND, later, for a package
  generated in place -- which is what should have tipped me off immediately.
- **What was actually happening:** `/__cad/asset` serves raw files. A GENERATED
  entry's render package is served through a different route, so probing
  `/__cad/asset` with the `.step.py` path 404s no matter where the package
  lives. The model loads correctly in the Viewer from both locations.
- **The real lesson, and it is mine, not the repo's:** I verified a link at the
  page level (HTTP 200) and then "confirmed" it with an endpoint I had not
  checked was the right one, and reported a repo defect on that basis. Loading
  the page in a browser -- the thing the user actually does -- took one call and
  settled it. Check the artefact the way it is consumed, not the way that is
  convenient to curl.
- **Blocked:** no. **Fixed:** n/a -- there was no bug.

# Appendix — earlier log: the chronograph build

Running log of repo bugs, unexpected behavior, and doc gaps found while
building `models/renders/moonwatch/`. Watch-model problems do not belong
here. Format per entry: what I was doing, exact command, exact error/wrong
output, workaround, blocked?, fixed?

---

## 1. `packages/cadjs` ESM cannot be loaded standalone from a lightweight worktree

- **Doing:** extracting the `cinematic` theme preset JSON to author a
  presentation render theme (`node -e "import('./packages/cadjs/src/common/themeSettings.js')..."`).
- **Error:** `Cannot find package 'implicitjs' imported from packages/cadjs/src/common/camera.js`,
  then `Cannot find package 'three' imported from packages/implicitjs/src/common/camera.js`.
- **Cause:** worktrees are intentionally lightweight (no `node_modules`), and
  `cadjs` resolves `implicitjs`/`three` as bare specifiers, so even a module
  of pure data constants (`themeSettings.js`) cannot be imported without a
  full install.
- **Workaround:** symlinked `packages/cadjs/node_modules/implicitjs -> ../../implicitjs`
  and `packages/{cadjs,implicitjs}/node_modules/three -> <main checkout>/packages/cadjs/node_modules/three`.
- **Blocked:** no (workaround in minutes). **Fixed:** no (logged only —
  non-blocking; arguably by design).

## 2. `CADGEN_WARM=1`: killing the CLI client does not cancel the in-daemon job

- **Doing:** first build of `finishing_sampler.step.py` was slow (my own
  O(n^2) boolean accumulation); I killed the client
  (`pkill -f "scripts/gen finishing_sampler"`) and relaunched with fixed
  source.
- **Wrong output:** the relaunched client sat at 0% CPU for minutes. The
  daemon (pid from `$TMPDIR/cadgen-daemon-*.log`) was still burning ~600%
  CPU on the *killed* client's job — requests are handled sequentially, so
  the new run silently queued behind a job whose requester was gone.
- **Workaround:** `kill -9 <daemon pid>` (socket + staleness handling
  respawn a fresh daemon transparently on the next call).
- **Suggestion:** the daemon should abort a job when its client disconnects.
- **Blocked:** ~10 min lost. **Fixed:** no (workaround only).
- **FIXED in root source (2026-08-07):** the daemon now runs a liveness
  watchdog thread per request. Clients half-close their write side after the
  request, so read-EOF is normal — the probe is an empty stdout chunk (a
  protocol no-op for every client) sent every 0.5 s under a shared send lock;
  a failed send means the requester is gone, and the daemon logs, unlinks its
  socket, and exits, so the orphaned job stops burning CPU and the next
  invocation spawns a fresh daemon (the client already handles a missing
  socket that way). Test: `test_d_client_disconnect_aborts_orphaned_job` in
  `tests/python/skills/cad/cadgen_daemon/test_daemon.py`.

## 3. Sub-mm finishing booleans: overlapping-tool networks are pathological (OCC, not a repo defect per se)

- **Doing:** perlage (overlapping 0.02 mm-deep spherical dimples) on a
  14×8 mm coupon for `models/renders/moonwatch/_finishing.py`.
- **Wrong output:** no error — `scripts/gen` sat in "Building geometry"
  indefinitely (>40 CPU-minutes for ~200 stamps; even ~60 stamps took
  minutes). Two escalating causes, both silent: (a) pairwise `a + b`
  accumulation of boolean tools is O(n²); (b) even in ONE multi-tool op,
  dimple spheres have ~15 mm radii, so every tool overlaps every other
  deep below the surface and OCC builds one giant intersection network.
- **Workaround (both applied):** batch all boolean tools into a single
  list-operand op, AND pre-clip each stamp to a small lens cap
  (`Sphere & Cylinder` prototype, translated copies) so tools are
  disjoint. 14×8 mm field: >40 CPU-min → 0.69 s.
- **Suggestion:** `scripts/gen` progress JSON could surface elapsed time
  per phase (it reports `ratio: 0.0` forever); a doc note in
  `references/build123d-modeling.md` about multi-tool list booleans would
  save others this cliff.
- **Blocked:** ~45 min lost. **Fixed:** in model helpers (no repo change).

## 4. `scripts/gen` prints nothing to stdout/stderr during long builds

- **Doing:** first `scripts/gen finishing_sampler.step.py` runs (issues 2/3).
- **Wrong output:** zero output for the entire run — no phase logging, no
  heartbeat; the only liveness signal is a hidden
  `__cadgen__/models/.<name>.generation.progress.json` (whose `ratio`
  stays 0.0 in the generate phase) plus `ps`. Made the hang look like a
  crash and cost several kill/retry cycles.
- **Workaround:** watch the progress JSON + process CPU by hand.
- **Blocked:** contributed to the ~45 min above. **Fixed:** no (logged).

## 5. Near-tangent boolean tools are dropped SILENTLY (OCC kernel via build123d)

- **Doing:** case cluster — flat crystal/crown/pusher domes built by intersecting
  huge near-tangent spheres (R≈1700 mm) with small revolves; also a crystal
  multi-tool subtract.
- **Wrong output:** no error, exit 0, `inspect validate` clean — but half a
  tool's material was silently not removed (pusher head half-vanished), and one
  subtract left a stray disjoint 21.6 mm³ solid floating inside the crystal.
  Classic silent-no-op/degenerate-geometry behavior at near-tangency; only
  visual snapshot review caught it.
- **Workaround:** avoid near-tangent booleans entirely — build such domes as a
  single revolved profile (RadiusArc in the profile), which is also crisper.
- **Blocked:** no (caught in builder self-review). **Fixed:** in model source.

## 6. Snapshot renderer shows transparent parts (alpha < 1 source colors) as milky-opaque

- **Doing:** case cluster snapshots; `crystal` has color alpha 0.16, sapphire
  0.14 (confirmed present in the artifact descriptor).
- **Wrong output:** in `scripts/snapshot` renders the crystal reads as a milky
  solid dome rather than glass; unclear whether the GLB bakes alpha and the
  snapshot material ignores it, or alpha is dropped earlier.
- **Workaround:** none yet; to be re-checked at whole-watch compose (may need
  `display.mode` tweaks or a transparent-materials fix).
- **Blocked:** not yet (cosmetic until final renders). **Fixed:** no.
- **Root cause (traced):** two independent alpha drops.
  1. `packages/cadgen/src/cadgen/_internal/glb.py add_material()` bakes the
     RGBA into `baseColorFactor` but never sets `alphaMode: "BLEND"`, and glTF
     defaults to OPAQUE → alpha ignored by conformant loaders. **Fixed in root
     source** (BLEND set when alpha < 1) — helps standalone GLB exports.
  2. The component-package compose path drops alpha entirely: descriptor
     occurrence override colors go through
     `packages/cadjs/src/lib/assembly/meshData.js linearRgbToHex()` (3
     channels only), and `lib/viewer/surfaceMaterials.js` derives opacity
     solely from theme/display-mode settings — there is no per-part opacity
     concept at all. A real fix means threading alpha through part records
     into per-material `transparent`/`opacity`; too invasive for this
     project's "minimal targeted fixes" rule.
- **Adopted workaround:** snapshot renders `--hide` the glass occurrences
  (crystal, caseback sapphire); optically defensible for macro shots.

## 7. Snapshot JSON jobs silently ignore unknown top-level keys (`hide` vs `selection.hide`)

- **Doing:** hiding the crystal in a `--job` render; wrote top-level
  `"hide": ["#o1.5"]` by analogy with the `--hide` CLI flag.
- **Wrong output:** no error, no warning — the job rendered normally with
  nothing hidden (two identical renders before the cause was found). The
  correct schema is `"selection": {"hide": [...]}`; the CLI flag maps to it
  internally (`merge_focus_hide_options`).
- **Suggestion:** reject or warn on unrecognized top-level job keys; the help
  text describes `--focus`/`--hide` flags but not the job-JSON field shape.
- **Blocked:** ~10 min. **Fixed:** no (workaround: use `selection.hide`).
- **Same trap, per-output variant (case lug fix, 2026-08-06):** a
  `"selection": {"hide": [...]}` object nested inside an `outputs[]` entry is
  ALSO silently ignored — `selection` is read only at job level
  (`__main__.py` `job.get("selection")`), and unknown per-output keys are
  dropped without warning, so the render completes with nothing hidden. To
  hide parts in one view of a multi-view job, split it into separate jobs in
  a `{"jobs": [...]}` array.
- **FIXED in root source (2026-08-07):** `resolve_render_job` and
  `normalize_common_job` now validate jobs and outputs against closed key
  schemas (`SUPPORTED_JOB_KEYS` / `SUPPORTED_OUTPUT_KEYS`). Top-level
  `hide`/`focus`/`refs` get a message naming the `selection` object shape; a
  per-output `selection` gets the split-into-jobs fix; any other unknown key
  is rejected with the supported set listed. Covered by four new tests in
  `tests/python/skills/cad/snapshot/test_cli.py`.

## OCC chamfer on dome/eye-cap tangent chains: silent fail, minutes-long churn, or segfault (bracelet)

- **Where found:** `models/renders/moonwatch/_bracelet.py` (flat three-link
  bracelet rows: gently domed top face tangent to knuckle-eye cap cylinders at
  both link ends).
- **Symptom:** `chamfer()` on the link top/bottom perimeter edges behaved three
  different ways depending only on the exact link width (taper step): silent
  failure (safe_chamfer returns unchanged), ~90 s per attempt CPU churn (366 s
  through the retry ladder for ONE link — one row cost 265 s), or a hard
  uncatchable SIGSEGV inside OCC. First full gen took 11 min and standalone
  builds segfaulted at reproducible-but-width-dependent links.
- **Amplifier:** `_finishing.safe_chamfer`'s 0.7x retry ladder multiplies the
  churn 4-5x before giving up, and gives no signal that it degraded/failed.
- **Workaround (adopted):** never 3D-chamfer edges belonging to a tangent chain.
  The bracelet links now carry the side bevel in the extruded/lofted SECTION
  (octagonal profile with built-in 45-degree bevels, `_plan_prism`) and only
  chamfer isolated flank arc edges. Gen dropped 11 min -> ~28 s.
- **Blocked:** no. **Fixed:** worked around in model source; the underlying
  fragility is OCC's; consider a max-attempt-time guard in `safe_chamfer`.

## step_export warns "Unknown Compound type, color not set" for uncolored group compounds

- **Where found:** every `scripts/gen` run of
  `models/renders/moonwatch/bracelet.step.py` (labeled assembly with
  `strap_12`/`strap_6`/`clasp` group compounds; colors on leaves only, per the
  documented rule that color on a group compound is ignored anyway).
- **Symptom:** `packages/cadgen/src/cadgen/step_export.py:379` emits
  `UserWarning: Unknown Compound type, color not set` for each intentionally
  uncolored group node, so the recommended color-the-leaves pattern always
  builds with warning noise.
- **Expected:** group compounds without colors are the documented normal case
  and should not warn.
- **Blocked:** no (cosmetic/noise). **Fixed:** no.

## models/renders/moonwatch/_finishing.py: `align=(None,None,None)` is not "centered"

Found by the movement-base builder (2026-08-06). In build123d,
`align=(None, None, None)` places primitives at their RAW OCC datum —
`Cylinder`/`Cone` base at z=0 (XY centered), `Box` corner at the origin —
while `_finishing.py` (and `finishing_sampler.step.py`) were written assuming
it means centered. Verified empirically:

- `Cylinder(1, 2, align=(None,None,None))` -> z [0, 2] (not [-1, 1]).
- `Box(2, 2, 2, align=(None,None,None))` -> [0,2]x[0,2]x[0,2].

Downstream effects in `_finishing.py` (all silently wrong, no errors):

- `slotted_screw`: the slot cut box is corner-origin, so the "slot" is an
  off-center notch buried at mid-head height (x [0, 1.2*d], y [0, w]); the
  head-top datum is +head_height/2, not 0; the shank is shifted up by
  head_height/2 and pokes ~0.13 through the dome as a stub; the rim chamfer
  edge selector never matches (selects at -head_height, actual -h/2).
- `jewel_countersink_cut`: the cone is half above the surface and its flare
  is inverted (wider at depth -> undercut, not a polished countersink).
- `jewel`: top at +thickness/2, not 0 (jeweled_bearing partly compensates).
- `perlage_cutter`: the lens-cap prototype is clipped to z >= 0 by the raw
  cylinder, so at the documented "surface at z=0" datum the stamps remove
  NOTHING. (The sampler coupon only shows perlage because its plate is also
  built corner-origin with its top at +0.6.)
- `geneva_stripes_cutter`: bands are corner-origin: the field is offset +y
  by span_y*0.65 and the cutting band sits ~+0.46..+0.53 above the
  documented z=0 surface (again accidentally compensated in the sampler).
- `train_wheel`: the crossing-out ring/spoke cutters span z [0, web+0.02]
  against a web extruded both=True (z [-web/2, +web/2]), so spoke windows
  are only cut through the TOP HALF; a membrane floor remains in every
  window.
- `pinion`: body spans z [0, length] (not mid-plane 0) and the leaf boxes
  are offset half a leaf-width tangentially.

`_mvt_base.py` works around all of these locally (centered primitives via
default align, corrective cones/slots/window-cutters layered on top of the
helper output) without editing `_finishing.py`. Proper fix: change
`_finishing.py` to use default (centered) alignment and re-verify the
sampler; other movement builders should audit any direct use of these
helpers at documented datums.

## `_bracelet.py` end link hit the same `align=(None,None,None)` corner-origin footgun (silent, shipped)

- **Where found:** `models/renders/moonwatch/_bracelet.py` `make_end_link`
  (2026-08-06, while giving the bracelet links crowned sections). Same root
  cause as the `_finishing.py` entry above: `align=(None, None, None)` is the
  RAW OCC datum (Box corner at origin), not "centered".
- **Symptom:** two silent geometry defects in the shipped bracelet model, both
  probe-confirmed on the pre-fix source:
  - the "hollow back" cutter `Pos(0, 23.05, 1.7) * Box(16.6, 3.7, 2.4,
    align=(None,None,None))` spanned x [0, 16.6], z [1.7, 4.1] — it hollowed
    ONLY the +X half and cut up through the top surface (material probe at
    (+4, 24.5, 3.0) = empty, (-4, 24.5, 3.0) = solid);
  - the groove-pair cutters sat with their corner ON the top surface and
    extended upward, so the three-link separation grooves removed nothing.
- **Fix:** switched both cutters to default (centered) alignment in the same
  change that crowned the links. The class of bug is already documented above;
  this entry records a second independent module that shipped with it —
  auditing other `align=(None,None,None)` uses across `models/` is warranted.
- **Blocked:** no. **Fixed:** in `_bracelet.py` (this entry's instance only).

## build123d 2D sketch algebra: pairwise `+` decays, CW polygons shatter the fuse, and `ShapeList & Sketch` is silently EMPTY (keyless builder)

- **Where found:** `models/renders/moonwatch/_mvt_keyless.py` lever/spring
  profiles (circle+quad capsule chains for the setting lever, yoke, setting
  lever spring).
- **Symptoms (all silent, exit 0, `inspect validate` clean):** parts extruded
  to NOTHING (a lever reduced to its pin+boss debris), or to 5-8 disjoint
  solid piles, or extruded DOWNWARD from the sketch plane. Three stacked
  causes, verified empirically:
  1. Pairwise 2D algebra decays: `Circle + Circle` returns a fused `Face`
     (not `Sketch`), and the NEXT `Face + Polygon` falls into raw shape fuse
     that returns an unregularized face pile; once any step yields a
     `ShapeList`, later `+` is Python list concatenation, not geometry.
  2. A CLOCKWISE-wound `Polygon(..., align=None)` fuses as a reversed face:
     the union "succeeds" but shatters into +Z/-Z mixed-normal fragments,
     and `extrude()` of that runs along the reversed normals (solids appear
     mirrored below the plane) as disconnected pieces.
  3. `ShapeList & Circle` (intersection used as a regularizing clip) returns
     an EMPTY ShapeList with no error, so the following extrude quietly
     produces a zero-volume part.
- **Workaround (adopted, same as `F.train_wheel`'s internal pattern):** build
  every 2D profile as ONE multi-operand list fuse `first + [rest...]` with all
  polygons wound CCW, and apply the `& Circle(clip)` regularizer exactly once,
  LAST. Never accumulate 2D unions pairwise, never `+` two clipped results.
- **Suggestion:** a note in `references/build123d-modeling.md` next to the
  existing multi-tool boolean guidance; possibly a lint for `Polygon` winding
  in helpers.
- **Blocked:** ~30 min across two debug rounds. **Fixed:** in model source.

## Per-component STEP/GLB export silently drops the color of bare-`Compound` leaves (cadgen)

- **Where found:** `models/renders/moonwatch/_bracelet.py` bracelet rebuild
  (2026-08-06). 25 of 57 leaf bodies (all boolean/chamfer chains that happened
  to return a bare `build123d.Compound` instead of `Part`) rendered without
  their assigned `.color` even though `part.color` was set and the assembly
  STEP looked correct.
- **Mechanism:** `packages/cadgen/src/cadgen/step_export.py` has two color
  paths. The assembly-tree path (`is_assembly=True`) colors every child label
  and is fine. But the per-shape path used when a leaf is exported ALONE (the
  component-GLB cache builds one doc per component) only recognizes
  `Part`/`Sketch`/`Curve` when picking the sub-shape explorer; any other
  `Compound` subtype hits `warnings.warn("Unknown Compound type, color not
  set")` and exports uncolored geometry. The warning is easy to miss (it
  deduplicates per callsite and interleaves with gen output), so the model
  ships with silently washed-out parts — here it erased the brushed-outer vs
  polished-center bracelet contrast that the source colors specify.
- **Workaround (adopted):** coerce every leaf to `Part` before assembling the
  labeled `Compound` (`Part(shape.wrapped)` + reattach `.color`), see
  `build_bracelet()`.
- **Suggestion:** in `_create_bin_xcaf_doc`, treat an unknown one-solid
  `Compound` like a `Part` (explore `TopAbs_SOLID`) instead of warning, or
  raise loudly; silent color loss on valid colored input is a data bug.
- **Blocked:** no; found while chasing weak finish contrast in renders.
- **FIXED in root source (2026-08-07):** `_create_bin_xcaf_doc` now explores a
  bare `Compound` leaf for its actual content (solids, then faces, then
  edges) and colors it like the recognized types; the "Unknown Compound type"
  warning is gone. Regression test:
  `test_colored_bare_compound_leaf_keeps_color_and_does_not_warn` in
  `tests/python/packages/cadgen/test_compound_assembly_generation.py`. This
  also removes the constant warning noise from the related "uncolored group
  compounds" entry above (same warn site).

## Mirrored `Polygon` points flip the face normal, so `extrude()` runs the OTHER way (build123d, silent misplaced boolean)

- **Where found:** `models/renders/moonwatch/_bracelet.py`
  `_corner_relief()` (2026-08-06): corner-relief pockets built from a point
  list mirrored with `[(-y, z) for y, z in pts]` for the opposite link end.
- **Symptom (silent, exit 0, `inspect validate` clean, 57 occurrences):**
  mirroring the 2D profile reverses its winding, which reverses the planar
  face normal, and `extrude(face, amount)` extrudes along the normal — so
  every mirrored-end pocket extruded in -X instead of +X. The cutter gouged a
  strip 0.7 mm AWAY from the intended corner (it ate the end link's left
  prong tail, and the far-recess corner pockets on center links landed inside
  the crown), while the intended fang was left uncut. Point-classifier
  probing (`BRepClass3d_SolidClassifier` on mirrored coordinates) was what
  exposed the asymmetry; renders alone were ambiguous.
- **Workaround (adopted):** when mirroring a profile, also reverse the point
  order (`[(-y, z) for y, z in reversed(pts)]`) so the winding — and the face
  normal — is preserved.
- **Related:** same root class as the CW-polygon entry above (winding decides
  normals decides extrude direction); this instance is about MIRRORED point
  lists specifically, which look innocent in review.
- **Blocked:** ~20 min. **Fixed:** in model source.

## OCC `chamfer` on blob-outline top rings: whole-ring fails, singles refuse concave junctions, grouped-after-neighbors SEGFAULTS

- **Where found:** `models/renders/moonwatch/_mvt_base.py` bridge anglage
  (2026-08-06, movement-base finishing pass). The bridges are extrusions of
  multi-circle union ("blob") profiles clipped to a disk.
- **Symptoms (probe-measured on plain extrusions, BEFORE any boolean):**
  - `chamfer(all_top_edges, length)` fails at EVERY width on the barrel
    bridge outline and only succeeds at ~0.10 on the train bridge / balance
    cock, so `_finishing.anglage_top`'s whole-list retry ladder shipped
    bridges with zero or ~0.10 anglage (the blind critic's "plain vertical
    extruded walls").
  - Single-edge `chamfer` raises catchable ValueError on any arc bounded by
    a concave circle-circle junction (most of the visually large arcs).
  - Single- or multi-edge `chamfer` on a body that already carries bevels on
    NEIGHBORING arcs can SEGFAULT the process (exit 139, uncatchable, killed
    `scripts/gen`). Reproduced on the train-bridge wheel-reveal cutout rim
    after 3 neighboring arcs were beveled.
- **Workaround (adopted):** never chamfer these rings; BAKE the 45-degree
  anglage into construction — extrude to `z_top - w`, then a tapered cap via
  `extrude(..., taper=45)`; when the draft prism itself fails (barrel
  outline: "BRepFill_TrimSurfaceTool ... incoherent intersection", and loft
  to `offset(prof, -w)` also fails), union per-circle `Cone(r, r-w, w)` caps
  clipped by the rim cone plus the inward-offset profile extruded through
  the band. Baked bevels also survive later booleans.
- **Suggestion:** extend the "no 3D fillet after big booleans" guidance: on
  multi-arc blob outlines, OCC chamfer is unreliable even BEFORE booleans,
  and sequential chamfering can hard-crash; prefer constructive bevels.
- **Blocked:** ~45 min. **Fixed:** in model source (`_bevel_extrude`).

## build123d 0.10: `Part(solid.wrapped)` reports `volume == 0`

- **Where found:** `models/renders/moonwatch/_mvt_base.py` stripe-shadow
  overlays (2026-08-06), splitting a multi-solid boolean result into one
  part per connected solid.
- **Symptom:** re-wrapping a `Solid`'s `TopoDS_Solid` as `Part(sol.wrapped)`
  yields a shape whose `.volume` is 0 (probe: `Box(1,1,1)` solid -> Part
  wrap -> volume 0). Any volume-based guard then silently discards real
  geometry — a `shadow.volume < 1e-6: shadow = None` check threw away the
  balance-cock overlay bands with no error.
- **Workaround:** use the `Solid` objects directly as labeled/colored
  compound children (Shape carries `label`/`color` fine), or fuse before
  measuring. Do not `Part(x.wrapped)` a bare solid.
- **Blocked:** ~15 min (bands present in `inspect validate` count yet
  invisible; traced via descriptor + volume probes). **Fixed:** in model
  source.

## OCC multi-tool subtract with overlapping bore + ring tools leaves junk solids

- **Where found:** `models/renders/moonwatch/_case.py` case-middle
  finishing (2026-08-06): one batched `body - (functional_cuts +
  flank_ring_cutters + grain_tools)` where the crown-tube seat bore
  cylinder overlaps a stack of thin circumferential V-ring cutters.
- **Symptom:** the single multi-tool `BRepAlgoAPI_Cut` returns a ShapeList
  of 5 solids instead of one: the main body, the crown-seat bore PLUG
  (volume ~18 mm^3 — material the bore tool should have removed, kept as a
  detached solid), and knife-edge slivers of the guard wall between
  adjacent ring cutters (~0.01 mm^3, detached skins). Every individual
  tool is a valid positive-volume solid; subtracting the same tools in two
  stages (functional cuts, then ring/grain cuts) yields one clean solid.
- **Workaround (adopted):** split heavily overlapping tool families into
  separate batched subtracts — still list-based multi-tool booleans, never
  pairwise accumulation. Downstream `Compound(children=...)` also fails
  loudly on the ShapeList ("not a subclass of NodeMixin"), which is how it
  surfaced.
- **Suggestion:** the "booleans over many tools: ONE operation" guidance
  needs a caveat: when tools overlap each other (a bore crossing a stack of
  near-tangent finishing cutters), OCC's multi-tool cut can emit wrong
  results; group tools so each batch is internally disjoint-ish.
- **Blocked:** ~20 min (typed probes per builder, then staged-subtract
  bisection). **Fixed:** in model source (two-stage subtract).

## 9. No per-part material properties in the component-GLB render path (missing feature; the project's aesthetic ceiling)

- **Doing:** whole-watch and movement blind A/B comparisons against professional
  macro photography (the moonwatch project's core acceptance loop).
- **Limitation:** the presentation theme applies ONE global
  roughness/metalness/clearcoat to every part; descriptor occurrence colors
  carry only RGB (see entry 6). There is no way to render brushed steel next
  to mirror-polished steel next to matte lacquer as *different material
  responses* — only albedo differs. Across ~20 fresh-context critic rounds,
  after all geometric finishing (anglage ribbons, V-groove striping, satin
  grain, snailing, perlage) was modeled and visible, every remaining loss
  verdict converged on the same sentence: "the metal has only one finish /
  uniform material response / reads as primed plastic."
- **Workarounds used:** geometric micro-texture (V-grooves at 0.14–0.2 mm
  pitch) + albedo deltas + bright overlay "ribbon" bodies for polished zones +
  raking key light + strong neutral HDRI. These moved every render
  substantially but cannot produce anisotropic specular contrast.
- **Suggestion (follow-up feature):** thread optional per-occurrence
  `roughness`/`metalness` (and finish the alpha channel from entry 6) from
  cadgen's descriptor into `packages/cadjs` part records and per-part
  materials; the snapshot runtime picks it up on rebundle. This is the single
  highest-leverage renderer change for photoreal CAD presentation.
- **Blocked:** the blind-A/B win condition, not the modeling. **Fixed:** no
  (out of minimal-fix scope; documented).

## `safe_chamfer`'s volume-only gate accepts BOP-self-intersecting chamfers that `inspect validate` then rejects

- **Where found:** `models/renders/moonwatch/_mvt_chrono.py` lever anglage
  (2026-08-07, chronograph-works cluster). `F.anglage_top` /
  `F.safe_chamfer` accept a chamfer result when `result.volume > 0`.
- **Symptom:** on some capsule-chain lever perimeters (reset lever, reset
  spring, brake lever) OCC `chamfer` at 0.14 returned a positive-volume solid
  whose skinny chamfer faces are BOP-faulty — `BRepAlgoAPI_Check` reports
  `BOPAlgo_SelfIntersect` + `BOPAlgo_TooSmallEdge` — so the retry ladder
  "succeeded" and shipped parts that `inspect validate` flags as
  `selfIntersecting` (3 failures). `BRepCheck_Analyzer.IsValid()` on the same
  solids is True, so simple topology validity checks do not catch it either;
  only the BOP check used by `cadgen.validity` does.
- **Workaround (adopted):** `_mvt_chrono._lever` wraps the ladder with its own
  `BRepAlgoAPI_Check` gate and steps the width down (0.7x) until the chamfer
  passes, else skips the anglage.
- **Suggestion:** `F.safe_chamfer`/`safe_fillet` should gate on the same BOP
  check `inspect validate` uses, not just `volume > 0` — silent acceptance
  here surfaces only at validation time with no pointer to the causing op.
- **Blocked:** ~15 min. **Fixed:** locally in `_mvt_chrono.py` (helper
  unchanged; other clusters using `anglage_top` on wavy outlines can hit it).

## `snailing_cutter` V-groove cuts can leave BOP-self-intersecting results when a groove wall runs tangent to the target's profile wall

- **Doing:** cutting circular Geneva striping (the `_mvt_base._bridge`
  pattern: `F.snailing_cutter(...)` rings about the movement center,
  intersected with a stripe band, subtracted from a blob-outline bridge) into
  the new chronograph coupling cock in
  `models/renders/moonwatch/_mvt_chrono.py` (2026-08-07).
- **Symptom:** the cut "succeeds" — one positive-volume solid,
  `BRepCheck_Analyzer.IsValid()` True — but `BRepAlgoAPI_Check` reports
  self-intersection, so `inspect validate` flags the part
  (`selfIntersecting`, 1 failure) with no pointer to the causing operation.
  Probe-bisected: the plain bevel extrude, jewel countersink and screw sink
  were all clean; adding the stripe cut alone flipped the part to
  BOP-faulty. The cock's outline circles sat at radii where a groove's wall
  cone ran tangent to the stripe-band inset wall (outline centers ~10.2–11.8
  from origin vs groove edge circles at 10.7 +/- 0.925, 12.6 +/- 0.925).
- **Workaround:** nudge the outline centers/radii by ~0.03 until the
  tangency breaks (`COUPLING_COCK_OUTLINE` comment records the tuned
  values); verify with `BRepAlgoAPI_Check` per part before shipping.
- **Suggestion:** same class as the `safe_chamfer` entry above — cutters
  built from `F.snailing_cutter` (and other tangency-prone V-groove tools)
  should be BOP-checked after the boolean by the shared vocabulary, or
  `inspect validate` should name the last boolean when a part fails.
- **Blocked:** ~20 min (bisecting which cut was faulty). **Fixed:** locally
  (geometry nudged; helper unchanged).

## OCC kernel operations are broadly fragile on dense periodic B-spline profile faces (taper extrude, wire offset, coincident-face fuse, ruled loft at sharp corners)

- **Doing:** replacing the moonwatch bridge outlines (blobbed circle chains)
  with smooth closed silhouettes — ONE periodic `Spline` fit through ~250
  Catmull-Rom samples per bridge, `make_face`, then the `_bridge` factory's
  bevel/stripe/ribbon machinery — in
  `models/renders/moonwatch/_mvt_base.py` / `_mvt_chrono.py` (2026-08-07).
- **Symptoms** (each probe-verified in isolation on build123d 0.10 / OCP
  7.9):
  1. `extrude(face, amount, taper=45)` (`LocOpe_DPrism`) throws on EVERY one
     of the six spline profiles — `BRepFill_TrimSurfaceTool::IntersectWith:
     incoherent intersection`, `NCollection_DataMap::Find`,
     `BRepFill_MultiLine: ValueOnFace` — although the same call succeeds on
     small hand-sampled spline faces (~40 pts).
  2. `offset(face, -d, kind=Kind.ARC)` (`BRepOffsetAPI_MakeOffset` via
     `Wire.offset_2d`) returns Null (`ValueError: Null TopoDS_Shape
     object`) for EVERY inward delta on the balance-cock profile while
     outward deltas work; barrel/train/pallet profiles offset fine.
  3. Fusing two individually valid solids that share a coincident
     spline-bounded planar face (straight-wall extrude + its 45-deg bevel
     cap, common face = the same spline profile) returns an EMPTY result —
     `+` succeeds, `volume == 0`, zero solids — on the barrel profile only;
     the same construction fused clean on the other five.
  4. `BRepOffsetAPI_ThruSections` (build123d `loft(..., ruled=True)`)
     between a profile and its inward offset builds but is
     `BRepCheck_Analyzer`-INVALID when the outer wire has sharp corners
     (the ruled surface folds where outer corner radius < offset delta).
- **Workarounds (adopted, in `_mvt_base.py`):** compute ALL profile offsets
  numerically on the dense sample loop (normal offset + drop points closer
  than |delta| to the source polyline — the classic offset-validity prune —
  + resample + light smoothing), never calling kernel offset; build the
  beveled body as ONE 3-section ruled loft (wall, wall, inward offset) so no
  coincident-face fuse exists; give outline traces explicit corner-rounding
  points at rim junctions; derive the polished-ribbon shell from the body's
  own cap translated vertically (a 45-deg cone translated up by d equals the
  cone grown horizontally by d) instead of lofting a second grown pair.
- **Suggestion:** treat `extrude(taper=)`, kernel wire offset and
  coincident-face fuses as unavailable for interpolated many-point spline
  profiles; prefer ruled lofts between numerically offset sections. (This
  also supersedes the previous entry's `COUPLING_COCK_OUTLINE` 0.03-nudge
  note — the blob outlines it tuned no longer exist.)
- **Blocked:** ~1.5 h across the four failures. **Fixed:** locally
  (helpers in `_mvt_base.py`; kernel behavior unchanged).

### Entry 9 addendum (final, 2026-08-07)

Per-part PBR materials + opacity WERE subsequently implemented (root sources,
entry 6/9 suggestion; commit "render pipeline: per-occurrence PBR material
overrides + opacity"). They transformed the renders — real glass, lacquer,
mirror-vs-brushed steel — and moved blind-critic verdicts from "clay toy" to
component-level finishing quibbles. Nine further whole-watch rounds still
lost against professional photographs of the actual reference watch; late
verdicts repeatedly named features that demonstrably exist in the geometry
(striping, anglage ribbons, domed jewels, slotted screws), indicating the
remaining delta is renderer-class: no anisotropic BSDFs, no path-traced
bounce/DOF/grain. A photoreal path-tracing backend (or export to one) is the
next real step for the blind-A/B-vs-photograph bar; the modeling side is no
longer the limiting factor.
